## What does this project do?

Basically it checks periodically if there are any changes on your remote git repository. If it does, it will auto-pull them, thus keeping your folder always up to date. You can use it on a development server, so your developers can see their changes instantly, for example.

## Instalation
```
npm install -g devmind-vigilance
```  
## Usage
```
devmind-vigilance --path /path/to/your/git/folder
```
